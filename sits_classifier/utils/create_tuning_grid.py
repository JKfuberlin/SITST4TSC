    d_model = [512, 1008] # 128 - 1028 This parameter represents the dimensionality of the model. Higher values provide the model with more capacity to learn complex patterns but also increase computational requirements.
    nhead = [4, 8] # 2 - 16 The number of attention heads. A higher number allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence simultaneously.
    num_layers = [6, 12] # 2 - 12 This parameter controls the depth of the model. Deeper models can capture more intricate patterns but might require more data and computation.
    dim_feedforward = [256, 1028, 4096] # 256 - 4096 This is the dimensionality of the feedforward networks within the transformer. A larger dimension allows the model to learn more complex representations.
    batch_size = [16, 128] # 16 - 128 Reasoning: Batch size affects the number of samples used in each iteration. A larger batch size can lead to more stable training but requires more memory.
